monokai-complete-syntax
=======================

A monokai theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/).

### Note:

_Monokai complete_ should be used in __Atom 1.7.0+__.

##Â Why yet another monokai theme ?

Most themes I found were not complete. I made sure in this implementation to adapt the theme for all (it's in progress) languages AND markdown preview.
To do so, I've copied the code from the theme [One-dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax), which the best atom-maintained theme in my opinion and updated the colors.

The license has been copied from that of one dark.

## What does it look like ?
